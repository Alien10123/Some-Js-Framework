# Some JS Framework

Status: I havn't even built the combiler, yet how do you even use it?

Hi, I am just building this js framework as pratice for fun, and will never use it. Currently I am building the compiler for a svelte like programming language. I very highly recommend you use [bun js](https://bun.sh) as it has built in support for typescript and is quire fast. To set the project up just do `bun install` and then `bun lexer.ts`. Right now you have to edit the lexer.ts file to change the input. You can contribute if you want to but I'm just doing this for fun.
